The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\\n\\n(CNN) Years ago, when I hosted a daily talk-radio show, one of the cardinal rules laid down by my program director was to avoid booking guests or taking phone calls from listeners who wanted to debate abortion, gay marriage or the death penalty. All three issues -- and especially abortion -- were considered a conversational dead-end, on which nearly all intelligent adults have already made up their minds.\\n\\nAny sort of abortion \\\"debate\\\" would inevitably turn into a shoutfest yielding circular arguments, bad feelings and bored listeners.\\n\\nI thought about that rule of thumb as I read about the elaborate media hoax ginned up by the Center for Medical Progress, a right-wing group trying to discredit and defund Planned Parenthood.\\n\\nTaking a page from the falsehoods and selectively-edited videos that brought about the defunding and bankruptcy of the left-wing advocacy group ACORN, the Center for Medical Progress strategy is to create a narrative, claim that its videos constitute damning evidence, and repeat that story enough times to give politicians the \\\"proof\\\" they need to attack Planned Parenthood.\\n\\nThat plan appears to have fizzled already, with the failure of a Senate vote this week to defund Planned Parenthood. But that won't stop the anti-abortion advocates, who will always see themselves as just one more rally, prayer vigil or media hoax away from ultimate victory.\\n\\nDespite the extensive preparation and deceit that went into the plan, the hoax won't shift the country's decades-long stalemate over abortion by so much as a millimeter. As it says in the book of Ecclesiastes: \\\"What has been will be again, what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun.\\\"\\n\\nBy law, women getting abortions can voluntarily donate the tissue from that procedure to medical research, and by law the abortion provider can request nominal reimbursement $30 to $100 in most cases -- for saving, packing and shipping the tissue to a research firm.\\n\\nThe details of the process are enough to trouble anyone: non-medical people don't talk about the price of requesting, removing and shipping organs and pieces of flesh from place to place. Most of us would freak out if we listened to professionals in the local hospita l, funeral home or medical examiner's office discuss details of how a dying person's request to have their body parts donated for transplants or scientific research actually gets carried out.\\n\\nIt turns out that cadavers, livers, kidneys, eyes and other organs don't walk themselves over to the local hospital or medical school for free.\\n\\nSo let's acknowledge up front that some startling, even grisly conversations will inevitably follow when women getting an abortion agree to donate the stem cells and other tissue to scientific research. But that doesn't equate to selling body parts.\\n\\nTranscripts of the videos created by the Center for Medical Progress show instances of the hoaxers posing as medical middlemen, trying to lure Planned Parenthood staffers into talking about how money gets paid to abortion providers who take nominal reimbursements for moving body tissue from clinics to research facilities.\\n\\nAnd in case after case, what emerges is medical professionals highly aware and cognizant of their duty to be careful and ethical about their words and actions.\\n\\n\\\"Really their bottom line is, they want to break even. Every penny they save is just pennies they give to another patient. To provide a service the patient wouldn't get,\\\" says Dr. Deborah Nucatola, senior director of medical services for Planned Parenthood Federation.\\n\\nLater in the same conversation she says: \\\"we're not looking to make money from this. Our goal is to keep access available. And if we do something that makes a target, that just removes access for everybody.\\\"\\n\\nAnd later: \\\"Our goal, like I said, is to give patients the option without impacting our bottom line. The messaging is this should not be seen as a new revenue stream, because that's not what it is.\\\"\\n\\nOn and on it goes, in each of these supposedly \\\"bombshell\\\" videos, forming what could be called an inkblot conversation, similar to the Rorschach tests in which the viewer looks at an inkblot and describes what picture they see.\\n\\nTo those already convinced that abortions should be safe, legal and rare, it looks like Planned Parenthood is responsibly doing exactly what a medical provider should. People who already want to ban all abortions everywhere will see the conversations as some nefarious trade in baby parts.\\n\\nIn other words, the videos are less an investigative expose than a mirror in which a divided nation can look at its view on abortion.\",\n          \"President Obama indicated Thursday that he is preparing to announce Cuba\\u2019s removal from the U.S. State Department\\u2019s list of state sponsors of terrorism, a move that should quickly lead to a full restoration of diplomatic ties and the opening of embassies in Havana and Washington.\\n\\nSpeaking at a gathering of Caribbean leaders here, Obama said the State Department had finished a review of the issue. There is little doubt that it recommends he drop Cuba from the list, and the only real question is when the announcement will be made.\\n\\nThat could come as early as this week, as Obama attends a summit of Latin American leaders that for the first time will be joined by Cuban President Ra\\u00fal Castro. Administration officials said a decision on when the president will take action has not been finalized and awaits formal consultation with other affected government agencies.\\n\\n[Read: Rare poll shows vast majority of Cubans welcome closer ties with U.S.]\\n\\nBut anticipation is already running high, and Caribbean leaders with whom Obama met on Thursday voiced strong approval for the new era in U.S.-Cuba relations. \\n\\nIn Washington, Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin (Md.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, issued a statement saying he welcomed what he said was the positive State Department recommendation.\\n\\nObama confirmed that the White House had received the review but said he would \\u201cnot make an announcement today.\\u201d He added, \\u201cI do think we\\u2019re going to be in a position to move forward on opening embassies.\\u201d\\n\\nAs he began a meeting with Jamaican Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller, Obama noted that a new poll of Cuban public opinion, published in Thursday\\u2019s edition of The Washington Post, demonstrated \\u201coverwhelming support\\u201d for the normalization process and \\u201coverwhelming interest by most Cubans to put one era behind us and move forward.\\u201d\\n\\n[Read: What it means to drop Cuba from list of terrorism sponsors]\\n\\nA positive announcement on the terror-list decision would be welcomed at the two-day Summit of the Americas, which Obama will attend on Friday and Saturday in Panama with up to 35 other leaders from across the Western Hemisphere. The summit is held every three years, and this will be Castro\\u2019s first time in attendance. It will be Obama\\u2019s third time, following meetings in 2009 and 2012 that were overshadowed by U.S. insistence that Cuba be excluded.\\n\\nAdministration aides have strongly hinted that Obama and Castro will meet for more than a handshake at the summit, but they have not specified the nature of the encounter.\\n\\nA White House official said Thurwday: \\u201cI can confirm that President Obama spoke with President Castro on Wednesday, before President Obama departed Washington.\\u201d\\n\\nSecretary of State John F. Kerry also met with Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodr\\u00edguez Parrilla late Thursday in Panama City, the Associated Press reported.\\n\\nAs delegations gathered on the eve of the summit, the presence of communist Cuba made for some extraordinary and also ugly scenes.\\n\\nIn one part of town Thursday, at a forum for the chief executives of major U.S. companies including Facebook, Coca-Cola and Boeing, a Cuban trade official invited America\\u2019s corporate leaders to visit the island, telling them his country was open for business.\\n\\nBut at a parallel event at a different location, raucous pro-\\n\\nCastro crowds disrupted a gathering of nonprofit and civil society groups, blocking Cuban dissidents from participating and denouncing the event\\u2019s organizers for daring to invite them.\\n\\nThe tensions, which had boiled over into a wild melee Wednesday in a city park, were a reminder that Cubans\\u2019 deep divisions will persist long after the United States reopens an embassy in Havana.\\n\\n\\u201cWe are deeply concerned by reports of attacks targeting civil society representatives in Panama for the Summit of the Americas exercising freedom of speech and harassment of those participating in the Summit of the Americas Civil Society Forum,\\u201d said State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf, adding that the U.S. \\u201ccondemns those who use violence against peaceful protesters.\\u201d\\n\\nThe situation was also a sign that while the Castro government is increasingly willing to tinker with its economic model, the experiment doesn\\u2019t extend to politics. The government also remains determined to stifle critics well beyond Cuba\\u2019s borders.\\n\\nBut Rodrigo Malmierca D\\u00edaz, Cuba\\u2019s minister of foreign trade and investment, said in a speech that although U.S. sanctions continued to limit American business with the island, Obama\\u2019s recent moves were \\u201ca positive step.\\u201d\\n\\nMalmierca said the Castro government is seeking more than $8\\u00a0billion in foreign investment in its new effort to spur growth.\\n\\nOnce Obama approves the recommendation to delist Cuba, Congress will have 45 days to consider the proposal. But legislators have no power to alter such a recommendation except through new legislation, a move that is seen as unlikely. The administration has made the case to Cuba that Obama\\u2019s decision \\u2014 even before the end of the 45 days \\u2014 should be enough for the two countries to move forward on reopening embassies.\\n\\nCuba has said it cannot envision having full diplomatic relations with a country that has charged it with supporting overseas terrorism. In many ways, the U.S. designation, first imposed in 1982, is a Cold War relic. Although the United States strongly objects to Cuba\\u2019s domestic policies, it has offered no evidence for decades that Cuba is actively involved in terrorism abroad.\\n\\nLeaders of 14 of the 15 members of the Caribbean Community, known as Caricom, met here with Obama.

The move is directly related to the administration\\u2019s efforts to improve U.S. standing in the region and to undermine Venezuela\\u2019s attempts to draw the Caribbean states into its orbit. For years, Venezuela has used cut-rate oil to buy anti-\\n\\nAmerican support from cash-strapped Caribbean governments.\\n\\nIn recent weeks, Caracas, with money problems of its own, has rolled back energy subsidies to Caricom members. With an energy security program announced in January by Vice President Biden, the Obama administration hopes to help fund island infrastructure to receive and use U.S. gas and petroleum, and then to subsidize U.S. sales of energy products to the Caribbean.\\n\\nAs they try to wean island governments away from Venezuela, administration officials have also attempted to play down their difficulties with Caracas. Thomas A. Shannon, a senior aide to Secretary of State John F. Kerry, was in Venezuela on Thursday for meetings with President Nicol\\u00e1s Maduro. The visit aimed to give at least the impression that the United States is trying to smooth over its differences with the Maduro government before the Caricom meeting and the larger Summit of the Americas.\\n\\nMiroff reported from Panama City.

Police Violence and Resistance in the United States . Joan Brunwasser: Welcome back to OpEdNews, Maya. We last spoke back in January, 2015. Now, I'd like to discuss your recent piece: Death Penalty for Heroin Dealers? More Proof the Drug War Is Not Over . Who thought the drug war was over in the first place and why? - Advertisement - Maya Schenwar: There has been a shift in mainstream politics toward condemning the drug war, and for good reason. It has done nothing to stem drug misuse, and meanwhile it has resulted in the criminalization and incarceration of millions of people, overwhelmingly Black and Brown people. With countless studies demonstrating its \\\"failure\\\" (I put this in quotes because I don't think the drug war was actually devised to help people in the first place), politicians who defend it end up looking pretty bad. So the current line is to say it's in the past, and that we have a new approach to drugs going forward. The Obama administration, many state governments, and even conservative politicians (including the \\\"Right on Crime\\\" crowd) have said that we need to leave behind the old war on drugs. In February, Eric Holder said the drug war is \\\"over,\\\" and Obama increasingly talks about treating drug-related issues as \\\"public health problems\\\" instead of criminal problems. JB: How does that change anything: the disproportionate numbers of minority members locked up for possession, more single moms incarcerated for the same, families split up and minors left with no parent at home? Are they, then, opening the prison gates and saying, \\\"We were wrong. This was all a big mistake; it didn't work and we diverted and wasted billions of dollars that could have been used to good purpose. And we ruined your lives for nothing. Oops. Sorry.\\\"? MS: No, no one is opening the prison gates, unfortunately! There are some limited steps being taken toward scaling back drug-war-related incarceration. For example, Obama has issued hundreds of commutations to people serving super-long drug sentences. Some states have taken steps to reduce some very low-level drug offenses to misdemeanors instead of felonies, which means people are a lot less likely to be incarcerated for them. (California's Proposition 47 is an example of this, although the emphasis on \\\"low-level offenses\\\" has actually entrenched the idea that people should be severely punished for \\\"higher-level offenses.) - Advertisement - Obviously, in a number of states, marijuana is being decriminalized, and some are legalizing it. However, that doesn't mean there are no longer marijuana arrests -- in fact, an ACLU study released recently showed there were more marijuana possession arrests last year than arrests for all violent crimes. The study also showed that Black people are still disproportionately arrested in far greater numbers than white people, despite using marijuana at about the same rate as white people. JB: How do we understand this, Maya? Beyond being convinced that the whole penal system is seriously screwed up, what's the point of increased marijuana arrests? Is this a last gasp effort or at least partly to fill up jail cells and local or private prison coffers? MS: There wasn't an increase in marijuana arrests overall last year; there was a decrease. But obviously it was a small decrease, given that there was a larger number of possession arrests than all violent crime arrests. I don't think it's about filling private prison coffers. Ultimately, prisons are expensive for states, and I don't actually see money as a primary motivator to incarcerate people. Until we challenge criminality itself -- and challenge the white supremacy that underlies the US's version of criminality -- we won't be done with large-scale incarceration. We have to understand incarceration by looking at how people are being labeled as disposable and as \\\"dangerous,\\\" and how those things are racialized. Whether it's marijuana possession or something else, there will always be a convenient \\\"crime\\\" with which to charge Black and Brown people unless white supremacy itself is confronted. We also have to think about ableism, transmisogyny, patriarchy, economic injustice, capitalism -- really confronting the structures that make it possible for our society to lock millions of people in cages. If we look at the drug war through this lens, we understand that's it's not some stand-alone entity; it's one tool deployed by a larger power structure that continually targets marginalized people in order to keep itself going. JB: Good point. Does the fact that the penal dysfunction is part of a larger overarching dysfunction make it easier or harder to improve it? And what's ableism? I don't know that I'm familiar with that term. MS: I think the fact that it's part of an overarching structural problem means that it can't really been improved, per se -- it really has to be uprooted. I wouldn't say that can happen extremely easily; it's more a goal to move toward while making incremental changes. Ableism is the structural oppression against and devaluation of people with disabilities. One of the ways it plays out in relation to prison is the extremely high level of incarceration of people with psychiatric and intellectual disabilities. 'Locked Down, Locked Out: Why Prison Doesn't Work and How We Can Do Better' by Maya Schenwar(image by Berrett-Koehler Publishers) License DMCA JB: Quite true. I believe much of that shift occurred when President Reagan \\\"reallocated\\\" resources, closing many state mental hospitals and dumping the patients onto the streets and the unprepared public. And we've been paying the price, one way or another, ever since. What haven't we talked about yet? MS: There's of course much more to talk about, but we have to end things somewhere, right? One thing I'd caution people against is assuming that the automatic alternative to incarceration for people convicted of drug offenses should be drug treatment. First of all, most people arrested for drug offenses aren't dependent on drugs (most people who use drugs are not dependent on them); there are safe ways to use drugs and we have to challenge laws that stigmatize their use.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"REAL\",\n          \"FAKE\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\\n\\n(CNN) Years ago, when I hosted a daily talk-radio show, one of the cardinal rules laid down by my program director was to avoid booking guests or taking phone calls from listeners who wanted to debate abortion, gay marriage or the death penalty. All three issues -- and especially abortion -- were considered a conversational dead-end, on which nearly all intelligent adults have already made up their minds.\\n\\nAny sort of abortion \\\"debate\\\" would inevitably turn into a shoutfest yielding circular arguments, bad feelings and bored listeners.\\n\\nI thought about that rule of thumb as I read about the elaborate media hoax ginned up by the Center for Medical Progress, a right-wing group trying to discredit and defund Planned Parenthood.\\n\\nTaking a page from the falsehoods and selectively-edited videos that brought about the defunding and bankruptcy of the left-wing advocacy group ACORN, the Center for Medical Progress strategy is to create a narrative, claim that its videos constitute damning evidence, and repeat that story enough times to give politicians the \\\"proof\\\" they need to attack Planned Parenthood.\\n\\nThat plan appears to have fizzled already, with the failure of a Senate vote this week to defund Planned Parenthood. But that won't stop the anti-abortion advocates, who will always see themselves as just one more rally, prayer vigil or media hoax away from ultimate victory.\\n\\nDespite the extensive preparation and deceit that went into the plan, the hoax won't shift the country's decades-long stalemate over abortion by so much as a millimeter. As it says in the book of Ecclesiastes: \\\"What has been will be again, what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun.\\\"\\n\\nBy law, women getting abortions can voluntarily donate the tissue from that procedure to medical research, and by law the abortion provider can request nominal reimbursement $30 to $100 in most cases -- for saving, packing and shipping the tissue to a research firm.\\n\\nThe details of the process are enough to trouble anyone: non-medical people don't talk about the price of requesting, removing and shipping organs and pieces of flesh from place to place. Most of us would freak out if we listened to professionals in the local hospita l, funeral home or medical examiner's office discuss details of how a dying person's request to have their body parts donated for transplants or scientific research actually gets carried out.\\n\\nIt turns out that cadavers, livers, kidneys, eyes and other organs don't walk themselves over to the local hospital or medical school for free.\\n\\nSo let's acknowledge up front that some startling, even grisly conversations will inevitably follow when women getting an abortion agree to donate the stem cells and other tissue to scientific research. But that doesn't equate to selling body parts.\\n\\nTranscripts of the videos created by the Center for Medical Progress show instances of the hoaxers posing as medical middlemen, trying to lure Planned Parenthood staffers into talking about how money gets paid to abortion providers who take nominal reimbursements for moving body tissue from clinics to research facilities.\\n\\nAnd in case after case, what emerges is medical professionals highly aware and cognizant of their duty to be careful and ethical about their words and actions.\\n\\n\\\"Really their bottom line is, they want to break even. Every penny they save is just pennies they give to another patient. To provide a service the patient wouldn't get,\\\" says Dr. Deborah Nucatola, senior director of medical services for Planned Parenthood Federation.\\n\\nLater in the same conversation she says: \\\"we're not looking to make money from this. Our goal is to keep access available. And if we do something that makes a target, that just removes access for everybody.\\\"\\n\\nAnd later: \\\"Our goal, like I said, is to give patients the option without impacting our bottom line. The messaging is this should not be seen as a new revenue stream, because that's not what it is.\\\"\\n\\nOn and on it goes, in each of these supposedly \\\"bombshell\\\" videos, forming what could be called an inkblot conversation, similar to the Rorschach tests in which the viewer looks at an inkblot and describes what picture they see.\\n\\nTo those already convinced that abortions should be safe, legal and rare, it looks like Planned Parenthood is responsibly doing exactly what a medical provider should. People who already want to ban all abortions everywhere will see the conversations as some nefarious trade in baby parts.\\n\\nIn other words, the videos are less an investigative expose than a mirror in which a divided nation can look at its view on abortion.\",\n          \"President Obama indicated Thursday that he is preparing to announce Cuba\\u2019s removal from the U.S. State Department\\u2019s list of state sponsors of terrorism, a move that should quickly lead to a full restoration of diplomatic ties and the opening of embassies in Havana and Washington.\\n\\nSpeaking at a gathering of Caribbean leaders here, Obama said the State Department had finished a review of the issue. There is little doubt that it recommends he drop Cuba from the list, and the only real question is when the announcement will be made.\\n\\nThat could come as early as this week, as Obama attends a summit of Latin American leaders that for the first time will be joined by Cuban President Ra\\u00fal Castro. Administration officials said a decision on when the president will take action has not been finalized and awaits formal consultation with other affected government agencies.\\n\\n[Read: Rare poll shows vast majority of Cubans welcome closer ties with U.S.]\\n\\nBut anticipation is already running high, and Caribbean leaders with whom Obama met on Thursday voiced strong approval for the new era in U.S.-Cuba relations. \\n\\nIn Washington, Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin (Md.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, issued a statement saying he welcomed what he said was the positive State Department recommendation.\\n\\nObama confirmed that the White House had received the review but said he would \\u201cnot make an announcement today.\\u201d He added, \\u201cI do think we\\u2019re going to be in a position to move forward on opening embassies.\\u201d\\n\\nAs he began a meeting with Jamaican Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller, Obama noted that a new poll of Cuban public opinion, published in Thursday\\u2019s edition of The Washington Post, demonstrated \\u201coverwhelming support\\u201d for the normalization process and \\u201coverwhelming interest by most Cubans to put one era behind us and move forward.\\u201d\\n\\n[Read: What it means to drop Cuba from list of terrorism sponsors]\\n\\nA positive announcement on the terror-list decision would be welcomed at the two-day Summit of the Americas, which Obama will attend on Friday and Saturday in Panama with up to 35 other leaders from across the Western Hemisphere. The summit is held every three years, and this will be Castro\\u2019s first time in attendance. It will be Obama\\u2019s third time, following meetings in 2009 and 2012 that were overshadowed by U.S. insistence that Cuba be excluded.\\n\\nAdministration aides have strongly hinted that Obama and Castro will meet for more than a handshake at the summit, but they have not specified the nature of the encounter.\\n\\nA White House official said Thurwday: \\u201cI can confirm that President Obama spoke with President Castro on Wednesday, before President Obama departed Washington.\\u201d\\n\\nSecretary of State John F. Kerry also met with Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodr\\u00edguez Parrilla late Thursday in Panama City, the Associated Press reported.\\n\\nAs delegations gathered on the eve of the summit, the presence of communist Cuba made for some extraordinary and also ugly scenes.\\n\\nIn one part of town Thursday, at a forum for the chief executives of major U.S. companies including Facebook, Coca-Cola and Boeing, a Cuban trade official invited America\\u2019s corporate leaders to visit the island, telling them his country was open for business.\\n\\nBut at a parallel event at a different location, raucous pro-\\n\\nCastro crowds disrupted a gathering of nonprofit and civil society groups, blocking Cuban dissidents from participating and denouncing the event\\u2019s organizers for daring to invite them.\\n\\nThe tensions, which had boiled over into a wild melee Wednesday in a city park, were a reminder that Cubans\\u2019 deep divisions will persist long after the United States reopens an embassy in Havana.\\n\\n\\u201cWe are deeply concerned by reports of attacks targeting civil society representatives in Panama for the Summit of the Americas exercising freedom of speech and harassment of those participating in the Summit of the Americas Civil Society Forum,\\u201d said State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf, adding that the U.S. \\u201ccondemns those who use violence against peaceful protesters.\\u201d\\n\\nThe situation was also a sign that while the Castro government is increasingly willing to tinker with its economic model, the experiment doesn\\u2019t extend to politics. The government also remains determined to stifle critics well beyond Cuba\\u2019s borders.\\n\\nBut Rodrigo Malmierca D\\u00edaz, Cuba\\u2019s minister of foreign trade and investment, said in a speech that although U.S. sanctions continued to limit American business with the island, Obama\\u2019s recent moves were \\u201ca positive step.\\u201d\\n\\nMalmierca said the Castro government is seeking more than $8\\u00a0billion in foreign investment in its new effort to spur growth.\\n\\nOnce Obama approves the recommendation to delist Cuba, Congress will have 45 days to consider the proposal. But legislators have no power to alter such a recommendation except through new legislation, a move that is seen as unlikely. The administration has made the case to Cuba that Obama\\u2019s decision \\u2014 even before the end of the 45 days \\u2014 should be enough for the two countries to move forward on reopening embassies.\\n\\nCuba has said it cannot envision having full diplomatic relations with a country that has charged it with supporting overseas terrorism. In many ways, the U.S. designation, first imposed in 1982, is a Cold War relic. Although the United States strongly objects to Cuba\\u2019s domestic policies, it has offered no evidence for decades that Cuba is actively involved in terrorism abroad.\\n\\nLeaders of 14 of the 15 members of the Caribbean Community, known as Caricom, met here with Obama. Those in attendance \\u00adwelcomed the broader move toward normalization, which \\u00adSimpson Miller called \\u201ca bold and courageous move .\\u2009.\\u2009. for the good of all of our people.\\u201d Obama, she said, is \\u201con the right side of history.\\u201d\\n\\n[Obama moves to normalize relations with Cuba as American is released by Havana]\\n\\nWhile the focus of the Caricom talks covered regional security and economic development, Obama\\u2019s visit here is also part of a larger plan, which includes his outreach to Cuba. The move is directly related to the administration\\u2019s efforts to improve U.S. standing in the region and to undermine Venezuela\\u2019s attempts to draw the Caribbean states into its orbit. For years, Venezuela has used cut-rate oil to buy anti-\\n\\nAmerican support from cash-strapped Caribbean governments.\\n\\nIn recent weeks, Caracas, with money problems of its own, has rolled back energy subsidies to Caricom members. With an energy security program announced in January by Vice President Biden, the Obama administration hopes to help fund island infrastructure to receive and use U.S. gas and petroleum, and then to subsidize U.S. sales of energy products to the Caribbean.\\n\\nAs they try to wean island governments away from Venezuela, administration officials have also attempted to play down their difficulties with Caracas. Thomas A. Shannon, a senior aide to Secretary of State John F. Kerry, was in Venezuela on Thursday for meetings with President Nicol\\u00e1s Maduro. The visit aimed to give at least the impression that the United States is trying to smooth over its differences with the Maduro government before the Caricom meeting and the larger Summit of the Americas.\\n\\nMiroff reported from Panama City.

Police Violence and Resistance in the United States . Joan Brunwasser: Welcome back to OpEdNews, Maya. We last spoke back in January, 2015. Now, I'd like to discuss your recent piece: Death Penalty for Heroin Dealers? More Proof the Drug War Is Not Over . Who thought the drug war was over in the first place and why? - Advertisement - Maya Schenwar: There has been a shift in mainstream politics toward condemning the drug war, and for good reason. It has done nothing to stem drug misuse, and meanwhile it has resulted in the criminalization and incarceration of millions of people, overwhelmingly Black and Brown people. With countless studies demonstrating its \\\"failure\\\" (I put this in quotes because I don't think the drug war was actually devised to help people in the first place), politicians who defend it end up looking pretty bad. So the current line is to say it's in the past, and that we have a new approach to drugs going forward. The Obama administration, many state governments, and even conservative politicians (including the \\\"Right on Crime\\\" crowd) have said that we need to leave behind the old war on drugs. In February, Eric Holder said the drug war is \\\"over,\\\" and Obama increasingly talks about treating drug-related issues as \\\"public health problems\\\" instead of criminal problems. JB: How does that change anything: the disproportionate numbers of minority members locked up for possession, more single moms incarcerated for the same, families split up and minors left with no parent at home? Are they, then, opening the prison gates and saying, \\\"We were wrong. This was all a big mistake; it didn't work and we diverted and wasted billions of dollars that could have been used to good purpose. And we ruined your lives for nothing. Oops. Sorry.\\\"? MS: No, no one is opening the prison gates, unfortunately! There are some limited steps being taken toward scaling back drug-war-related incarceration. For example, Obama has issued hundreds of commutations to people serving super-long drug sentences. Some states have taken steps to reduce some very low-level drug offenses to misdemeanors instead of felonies, which means people are a lot less likely to be incarcerated for them. (California's Proposition 47 is an example of this, although the emphasis on \\\"low-level offenses\\\" has actually entrenched the idea that people should be severely punished for \\\"higher-level offenses.) - Advertisement - Obviously, in a number of states, marijuana is being decriminalized, and some are legalizing it. However, that doesn't mean there are no longer marijuana arrests -- in fact, an ACLU study released recently showed there were more marijuana possession arrests last year than arrests for all violent crimes. The study also showed that Black people are still disproportionately arrested in far greater numbers than white people, despite using marijuana at about the same rate as white people. JB: How do we understand this, Maya? Beyond being convinced that the whole penal system is seriously screwed up, what's the point of increased marijuana arrests? Is this a last gasp effort or at least partly to fill up jail cells and local or private prison coffers? MS: There wasn't an increase in marijuana arrests overall last year; there was a decrease. But obviously it was a small decrease, given that there was a larger number of possession arrests than all violent crime arrests. I don't think it's about filling private prison coffers. Ultimately, prisons are expensive for states, and I don't actually see money as a primary motivator to incarcerate people. Until we challenge criminality itself -- and challenge the white supremacy that underlies the US's version of criminality -- we won't be done with large-scale incarceration. We have to understand incarceration by looking at how people are being labeled as disposable and as \\\"dangerous,\\\" and how those things are racialized. Whether it's marijuana possession or something else, there will always be a convenient \\\"crime\\\" with which to charge Black and Brown people unless white supremacy itself is confronted. We also have to think about ableism, transmisogyny, patriarchy, economic injustice, capitalism -- really confronting the structures that make it possible for our society to lock millions of people in cages. If we look at the drug war through this lens, we understand that's it's not some stand-alone entity; it's one tool deployed by a larger power structure that continually targets marginalized people in order to keep itself going. JB: Good point. Does the fact that the penal dysfunction is part of a larger overarching dysfunction make it easier or harder to improve it? And what's ableism? I don't know that I'm familiar with that term. MS: I think the fact that it's part of an overarching structural problem means that it can't really been improved, per se -- it really has to be uprooted. I wouldn't say that can happen extremely easily; it's more a goal to move toward while making incremental changes. Ableism is the structural oppression against and devaluation of people with disabilities. One of the ways it plays out in relation to prison is the extremely high level of incarceration of people with psychiatric and intellectual disabilities. 'Locked Down, Locked Out: Why Prison Doesn't Work and How We Can Do Better' by Maya Schenwar(image by Berrett-Koehler Publishers) License DMCA JB: Quite true. I believe much of that shift occurred when President Reagan \\\"reallocated\\\" resources, closing many state mental hospitals and dumping the patients onto the streets and the unprepared public. And we've been paying the price, one way or another, ever since. What haven't we talked about yet? MS: There's of course much more to talk about, but we have to end things somewhere, right? One thing I'd caution people against is assuming that the automatic alternative to incarceration for people convicted of drug offenses should be drug treatment. First of all, most people arrested for drug offenses aren't dependent on drugs (most people who use drugs are not dependent on them); there are safe ways to use drugs and we have to challenge laws that stigmatize their use.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"REAL\",\n          \"FAKE\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
